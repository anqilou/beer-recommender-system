The malt brings some subtle bread, grain, and honey, setting a foundation for some seriously aggressive stone fruit hop notes. Once more, stone fruit is the theme, with apricot, peach, nectarine, papaya, and mango dominating thr flavour profile. There's some bright pineapple acidity that cuts through some of the sweetness, and then some forceful hop resins serve to dry it out, bringing pine, cut grass, whole cone hops, and some earthiness, with a firm, moderate bitterness with some pithy grapefruit.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is quite soft, per Tree House IPA standards, though it isnt quite as fluffy and pillowy as Green. It is a bit creamy and full-bodied, but not quite a smoothie. There's enough effervescence to help keep it crisp for its ABV, and the aggressive hop oils add a slight roughness, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Very drinkable for the size of the beer.\", 'Overall: I love the original Haze, as it has such a unique and identifiable flavour profile.

Totally lives up to its hype. I'm always wary of these highly-lauded beers as they can sometimes fall disappointingly short of their hype, and I try not to overload myself by reading other people's reviews or ratings as I don't want to unduly influence my own experience of the beer. Having said that, this was an incredible imperial stout - a 2018 vintage that I had been saving for a while now and was waiting until a memorable time (review #700). Pours a deep, dark, rich opaque black color with some great-looking dark tan head - initially foamy and fluffy, later settling to a nice cap. The lacing was more spotty than I would have liked, but it still lingering for a long time and if it had been more sheet-like I would have given an even higher rating for this beer's look. Smells absolutely incredible - tough to imagine another imperial stout with better aromas than this one. Dark, rich chocolate fudge, dark roast coffee, an incredible vanilla aroma, caramel, malt, brown sugar and a touch of roasted nuttiness. Good hit of oak and bourbon at the beginning and end. Taste follows the nose almost perfectly - no reduction in the complexity, depth or balance of the flavor notes. The vanilla was better than any vanilla aromas or notes I'd ever previously experienced in an imperial stout. Crisp, bright and fragrant, I could drink stouts infused with that vanilla any day of the week. Smooth, rich, slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. Decent amount of warming alcohol even when the beer was cold. Definitely a sipper. Pairs well with savory food - doesn't have to go with sweeter dessert like some other imperial stouts.

The fruitier notes from the first half all become overripe and then this citrus pithiness comes in, leaning way more orange than grapefruit. For a Galaxy-forward finish, it\\'s damn clean - suddenly getting fruity again before gently lifting off the palate leaving some resinous hop oils behind, and if I do say so... Some seriously delicious burps. Bitterness fades instantly and does not linger. Zero discernable ABV, and though I hate the term... Absolutely crushable.', \"Mouthfeel/Body: Basically King Julius.

Two fingers of bone white head slowly recede to a dense collar, with a halo of lacing around it. Tons of micro-bubbles can be seen rising up the sides of the glass, despite the beer's turbid complexion.\", \"Nose: Similar to Green in the sense that the Galaxy presence is quite clear, lending huge overripe stone fruit notes - peach and apricot, yes, but I'm actually getting a fair bit of nectarine here. Just loads of ripe, perhaps even slightly UNripe nectarine. The massive dry hop dank peppery note still lies beneath, just like Green. The big difference between the aroma of this and Green, is that Very Green leans way fruitier. There's an absolute blast of ripe tangy pineapple and juicy acidity, as well as quite the dose of tangerine juice. This beer is so intensely hopped that there's almost a minty, camphoraceous note to it, like squeezing a fresh, sticky hop cone. Pungent and full of terpenes. Very Green.\", \"Palate: First sip, and the beer absolutely bombards the palate with an explosion of Galaxy hops. A category 5 hurricane whirlwind of aggressive dankness and serious resins. A 5 alarm fire in the paper district, tastebuds up in smoke. Quickdraw McNally ten paces back from the crooked lawman, and Quickdraw didn't get his name by playin' fair. On the count of three, he draws on two, and puts a 16 ounce, 8.3 calibre Very Green slug right between the eyes of the lawman, sending him down with an oily, resinous, bitter thud. Aggressive and boisterous, the onslaught of earthy, peppery, piquant Galaxy hops deliver what I suppose are classic Galaxy notes, but turned up to 13. There's that musty, dank, way too ripe apricot, peach, and nectarine, and well as some bright acidid pineapple, but then a tsunami of earthy, green resins just flood the palate bringing some sharp black pepper and then the most saturated resinous bitterness I've tasted. It's bitter, don't be fooled, but it isn't the bitterness that stands out, but rather how insanely sense and saturated the hop delivery is. It's almost too concentrated to find any quieter notes. This is not a quiet beer. It's loud, bold, and entirely in your face. That bitterness peaks early, washing out the fruity pineapple, and turning into pure, raw Galaxy hops, which just linger on and on and on, with firm resins, clingy oils, and looking bitterness slowly escorting it away.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: Just like Green, it's big and soft, like a teddy bear. A teddy bear that can rip your face off with an explosion of hops, but it's still big and soft. The softness of Green always stuck out to me. The sheer aggression of the hops sort of lend a rawness to that fluffy body (as well as a rawness to the roof of your mouth!), but the amount of resinous hop oils make up for a lot of that. Effervescence is absolutely perfect, and even a bit lively given the nature and weight of the beer. Oils just cling all over the mouth and accumulate with every sip.\", \"Overall: This is an intense beer. Everything about it is intense. Its towering presence, its reputation, its hop bombardment of biblical proportions, its dense saturation, its firm, aggressive delivery...It is a serious beer, and anyone who fails to see why this is such a sought-after beer just hasnt had enough IPAs. This does everything it can to stand out and be recognised, and that's what's needed to for an IPA to have a fighting chance in today's world.

Plentiful visible effervescence. Very nice lacing left behind.', 'Nose: Very similar to Sip of Sunshine, but more Pliny. This definitely has more of a malt presence than Sip. Light notes of caramel and brown sugar beneath big Pacific Northwest hop notes. Lots of pine, lots of hoppy resins, huge grapefruit, some stone fruit in the form of peach and mango, a touch of tropical pineapple, and some earthy dank Simcoe. It\\'s surprisingly subdued - not as in-your-face as Heady Topper, but a similar profile. Not as fruity and \"New England\".', \"Palate: This is where it gets interesting. I was beginning to think this would just be a maltier Sip of Sunshine. No no no. First sip, and I'm immediately taken back by the punishing bitterness. It holds no punches, and immediately slaughters the palate with biting, resinous bitterness right from the start. This thing is hopped to high hell! It does have a fuller, bolder, sweeter malt presence than Sip, but it needs it to support that insane bite. Flavour-wise, lots of caramel malt up-front, and then pine sap. Resinous, piney, bitter pine sap. There's a big pithy grapefruit note as well. Just about as bitter and pithy as biting into actual grapefruit rind. Holy moly! There are whispers of fruit notes beneath the assault of all things hoppy and bitter, with the suggestion of some peach, apricot, mango, and pineapple, but that's quickly whisked away when that signature earthy boiled Simcoe note comes in, giving a huge nod to Pliny - if Pliny was on that Barry Bonds love potion number 9 joose. It's like getting pulled over after a high speed car chase even though all you did was run a stop sign. Sure, you can surrender, but you're getting pummeled either way, and it's gonna hurt. It finishes, leaving you somewhat violated, with that earthy dank Simcoe, pine sap, and pithiness, now without the grapefruit flavour. The bitterness claws into your tongue, eventually fading away, like the heat of a bhut jolokia.\", 'Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly full, in part due to its malt base, but even without the weight of the malt, with a level of bitterness like a kick from a mule straight to your Naddy Daddies, this one will stop you like a .50cal Barrett. Not a midsummer day quaffer. This is for when you want it to hurt, and you want it bad. Effervescence is fairly lively, once you survive the bitter assault long enough to realise it\\'s actually effervescent. Very little malt cloy or cling, but it leaves a kiss of stickiness on the lips, and of course, the bitterness lingers with no sign of leaving, like a transient after you\\'ve said, \"Sure you can spend the night in my basement and not do any drugs at all!\". Typical classic double IPA body, with typical classic trouble IPA bitterness. Some hop burn will in fact start to hurt the upper hard palate after a while.', \"Overall: Goodness gracias my I have another, señor?! This one really packs a hidden whopper, and not like those chicks in Bankok either! On the surface, it masquerades as a harmless little hybrid double IPA, but then when you taste it, there's clearly something very different about it. It really shares a lot in common with Pliny The Elder, in terms of its flavour profile. It has those signature SoS/Heady colours, but the bitterness here is on another level, really making this a beast all its own. It's a fantastic beer, and it's certainly unique. If you want a classic OG hop assault, and you have the grip not to drop the soap, give this one a try. ...just don't say I didn't warn you...\", 'May 22, 2020']\n",

Take your Rochefort or your Bernardus, and imagine it in its highest form. For a premium, that will be the Westy 12.', 'Westy 12 Review', '\\nThe Westvletren 12 is my 500th beer. And it marks my passage from beer drinker to beer appreciator. I am thirsty for more.', 'I chose the Westy to mark a half-thousand beers consumed not only because it is an excellent and well-regarded beer. It is symbolic. More than a sample of a precise chemical craft, or brewing, the Westy represents the origins of my beer hobby, and the evolution of my palate and my interest in the field of beer. Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer. It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe. And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes. I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.', 'I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren. Ambient noise and smells were minimized. Paper and pen were placed nearby, ready to receive observations and hastily scrawled epiphanies. I cleared my head of distractions (there are many) and focused exclusively on this laughably humble bottle and its innards. I girded myself for my Westvleteren 12.', 'The pour is pretty standard, even mundane. It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career. That evidence appears in the aroma. I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose. It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about. The Westy isn’t hype at all. It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved. And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much. It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair. A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor. And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami. To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last. That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.', 'With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled. This is not the case. The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate. The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them. It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.', 'By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel. It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide. But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this. The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition. These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves. But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well. This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows. One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer. And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew. This really is a fantastic hobby.', 'Cheers Stéphane!', 'Dec 25, 2019']\n",

Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now. Or a take out pack of six, or two, from the cafe opposite the monastery gates. This is what hype has done. But also, has not. This beer is the same now as I remember it >30 years ago. No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony. A truly personal experience, whether you are religious, agnostic or an atheist. Meanwhile, the myth shrugs its shoulders and keeps on delivering one world class, perhaps once in a lifetime, experience. Visit the Abbey. And have your ceremony.\", 'Finally. Just a note on its price. Bear with me here. If you are lucky enough to get to reserve a crate or two to collect, or buy it at the Cafe opposite the monastery, remember this. This beer is not supposed to be for resale. It is, however, MASSIVELY good value. A world class bargain. The rip off merchants that make this available through resell are doing so against the spirit of what Westvleteren beer is all about. So, feel the guilt if you bought this off site - but do not criticise the price you paid for it.', 'Nov 01, 2019']\n",

I’m not going to straight up say that I don’t like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive, because I myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while, but it’s probably because one of the things I value most about beer is that it’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature; if I like a beer, I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one, or run to the store and buy another without feeling like I could have done better things with my money—the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because I personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be, I normally won’t want to try another unless there’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip.', 'Given my totally made-up standards and personal values stated above, pastry stouts couldn’t stand any further from brews that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for.

Apparently German Chocolate Cake doesn’t really come from Germany, and despite its name, its main highlight is whipped cream and the coconut-pecan frosting that’s used to fill the cake. On a more relevant note, this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved Street Fighter ZERO character Hibiki Dan.', 'So for those of you that aren’t millennials or were living under a rock when Street Fighter, Dan’s character was created as a parody of SNK’s King of Fighters franchise characters Ryo and Robert, who very suspiciously resembled Street Fighter’s two most recognizable characters, Ryu and Ken. Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo.', 'Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day.\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\nA vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts, wild sugar cane, rum cake, baker’s chocolate, intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin, followed by a frosting-like sweetness. There’s a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth. Save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar, your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight again—the fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial “surprise”\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\nThe mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter, but it morphs into a more tolerable moist-ish soft texture with subsequent sips. The only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue.', 'May 12, 2019']\n",

This beer smells like a grade A whiskey with beer attributes. This smells so strong and so damn amazing.', 'Taste: Right upfront the beer hits with big chocolate notes. Dark chocolate brownie batter and dusty coco powder. The beer transitions to the mid palette where your hit with some dark fruit. Plum, fig, raisin as well as a touch of vanilla. The barrel starts to make an assertive presence as well. I get some whiskey leather and tobacco that carry on throughout the finish. In the finish this beer is all barrel. Whiskey, oak, coconut, leather, tobacco, maple syrup, rye spice, and a touch of dark cherry round out this beautiful beer. The whiskey and barrel notes linger in the aftertaste.', 'Feel: Full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. The beer is smooth but drinks big. This is definitely a classic example of a sipper.', 'Overall: This is a wonderful beer that highlights everything a whiskey barrel has to offer. If you don’t like whiskey you probably won’t enjoy this because it is the start of the show.

Some cork rot is visible.', 'Pours a clear ruddy deep reddish copper-brown hue, topped woth a finger of coarse pinkish-brown head that quickly reduces to a thin collar, fed by streams of effervescence climbing the glass walls.', \"Nose: Absolutely stunning right from the start. Bold, intense aromas of lightly toasted grains bringing a gentle caramel sweetness, big musty cherry that has begun to lose its battle with age, warm, fruity red wine notes, with just enough oxidation to lend some sherry and brandy characteristics, and a panoply of stewed dark fruits. There is a present, but balanced brettanomyces influence, lending the perfect amount of musty funk, forest floor, dusty cellar, petrichor, and this sort of morning-on-the-lake aroma. and it's all held together by a splintery oaken halo, which provides some leather, varnish, and old parchment. Beautiful.\", \"Palate: Supplication greets the palate drier than the aroma would lead one to believe. The grain peeks through just a touch, with a hint of dustiness, while the cherries, with all their sugars fermented out step up with big funky, mushy skin and pit notes. Interestingly, the wine character lacks all fruitiness, and reveals itself with dry, tannic, soaked cask notes. As it opens up, a plummy dark fruit note emerges midpalate. Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak. There's plenty of musty, dusty brett funk, reminiscent of overripe apricot pits, but there's also this subtle earthy, almost mold-like funk that may very well be from cork rot. The finish is exceedingly dry, with plentiful woody oak.\", 'Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is light to medium-bodied, bright, snappy, and exceedingly crisp for nearly 8% ABV. The grains to lend some soft texture, and the fruit addition, while dry, does lend additional body. Effervescence is lively, zippy, and foams up over the palate. Tannic and drying.', \"Overall: This is a very nice, classic fruited wild ale. I love the jammy stuff as much as the next person, but there's something beautifully rustic and raw about these ones. Every ounce of sugar has been fermented out, leaving a seriously musty, funky, fermented cherry flavour, relying on that touch of grain to give it body. The funk is very earthy, but plays well with the cherry, and the wine translates as mature, funky, wet oak - and lots of it. The subtle plummy notes are tasteful, and it all comes together to show the ale's depth and character. A fantastic offering.\", 'Sep 07, 2020']\n",

Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.9 degrees F.\\nAppearance – 3.\\nFirst pour – Medium brown, clear.\\nBody – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, brown around the top edge.\\nHead – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles fizzing away, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin complete ring of tiny bubbles, fed by aggressive effervescence.\\nLacing – None, not unexpected at 20.3% ABV.\\nAroma – 4 - Has an almost weak, watery dark fruit aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background, but I must really horn it to pick up the bourbon.\\nFlavor – 4 – This begins somewhat sweet with weak flavors of “dark fruit’’ with raisins being weakly predominant and prunes trailing behind. Dates are weakly present. No alcohol (20.3% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate occurs as it warms while being held in the mouth. No alcohol on the exhale, oddly enough. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.\\nPalate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.\\nFinal impression and summation: 4. Like the Chicxulub meteor, this burns all the way down my esophagus before striking my gastric mucosa, leaving a massive crater and wiping out all the helicobacter dinosaurs in my own, personal, mass extinction event.

Received both in a BIF from 2beerdogs, thanks!\\nThought I should start with the OG before moving on to the days of the week variants. Drank at recommended temperature of 55 (give or take). The pour is somewhat disappointing. Brown and cola like, 3/4\" of large bubbles that just fizzed away very quickly. Just about thought this was infected. Thankfully it is not. From my first whiff I get anise, some roast, a ton of bourbon, figs and just a hint of chocolate. Moving on to the taste. First sip was all the raisins. Going back for more produced just a bunch of heat, whiskey, burnt caramel. I\\'m getting some root beer, Hershey\\'s syrup on the back end, and definitely coconut and marshmallow from the wood. I\\'ve tasted old ales and barleywines that have these flavors but without this heat. If I had regular access to this I\\'d let it sit for a year or two. The booze is strong on this one.\\nNow to the most disappointing component...for a beer to be this big, I needed a thick, velvet coating of the mouth aspect. Black Tuesday does not have it.

A single tiny bubble-wide crown and no cap remain.\\nLacing – None.\\nAroma – 4 – Initially a very fruity grape odor which fades into a weak vinous fragrance.\\nFlavor – 4 – Begins slightly bitter with subdued grape flavor. Ends slightly dry with a bit of pink grapefruit aftertaste on the tongue. Not sure if the bitterness is from the grapes used, the lambic process, or some tannins from the barrels – it’s more of a background teeth-squeaking thing.

There is plenty of toasted barrel oak though, which emerges in the finish with dark chocolate, light coffee and cream, tawny port, vanilla, praline pecan, brown sugar, and caramel. Everything eventually slowly dries out, until all that's left is a lingering note of sweet malt.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: This barleywine really captures what do many barleywine fans love about barleywine. Straight out of the gate, this stuff ia just chewy, thick, viscous, you name it. It actually fights a little just getting past the lips, and it definitely clings - both on the lips and the palate. You can taste thing one for 5 minutes after a sip. Effervescence is extremely low. It isn't still - it still has some fuzz to it, but it's not a bubbly beer - just a little CO2 texture. Extremely full-bodied.\", \"Overall: I've heard a lot about this barleywine, but I didn't really discover Bourbon County until after this was already phased out. It really can't be lumped into an English or American-style category. It definitely leans English-style, but the darker, roasty malts give it some American flair. I'm not sure what the hop presence was like when this was fresh, but here, 6 years later, they're way in the background. Still, it has held up with very minimal detrimental oxidation, and it's just such a full, bold, well-rounded barleywine that really has everything going for it. I think age has actually smoothed this out a bit -cooling off the heat and smoothing out the bite. It's a fantastic barleywine with some darker malts in it, and while it's a bit of a dark fruit bomb, it really does have some nuance and subtly, and it's well worth seeking out to try - even at 6 years old.\", 'Jun 21, 2020']\n",

I can smell a bit of the sweet bourbon character and I think a bit of the chillies. Otherwise it smells like standard Bomb (which is to mean that it smells great!)

As it warms I can taste the booze a bit more than at first. It might be a bit much for some people.

Some roasty nuance, such as a hint of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine, but this is essentially sweet coffee.', \"Palate: Much like the nose, this is an absolute coffee bomb. It opens up quite sweet, with lots of cocoa from the roast, which lends its own coffee character as well. Moderate roast, accentuated by the coffee, but the hearty sweetness wins over. Secondary notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and unfortunately, lactose. I knew there was something unpleasant about this - there's clearly lactose in it. The lactose lends this quick spike of this almost aspartame/artificial sweetener flavour just before the finish, where it also extinguishes any sort of roast that may have been. Luckily, there's enough coffee for the more roasty notes of the bean to come through in the finish, which helps to dry it out.\", 'Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is full-bodied, and has a slick, oily feel to it. In addition to the naturally full body, the lactose definitely adds,some viscosity here, as does the sheer level of sweetness. Major stickiness is left clinging to the lips with this one. Effervescence is actually quite adequate - lower, but very fine and fizzy.', \"Overall: All the components of a great coffee stout are here. The beans themself are clearly primo quality, with zero green pepper or stale notes, the base stout is well-crafted, but - it's too sweet, and there's just too much lactose. In fact, if there weren't any lactose, i think it could pull off the sweetness just fine, but with both elements in place, it does become a bit cloying. I do not think the lactose benefits this beer in any way whatsoever. You can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar, and it ends up tasting more natural. It's still good, it's still drinkable, but I'd either like to see this tamed by a bourbon barrel, or just lose the lactose all together.\", 'May 29, 2020']\n",

Final temperature 62 degrees F.\\nAppearance – 3.\\nFirst pour – Medium brown, clear.\\nBody – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, a very deep red-amber, translucent. No legs.\\nHead – Large (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles nosily popping, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin partial ring of tiny bubbles, fed by effervescence. While not fizzy, the head demonstrates no tendency to last. At 18.9% ABV, this is not surprising.\\nLacing – None, again 18.9% ABV.\\nAroma – 4 - Has an almost watery raisin aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background.\\nFlavor – 4 – The flavor is somewhat elusive, starting slightly sweet and a bit fruity, without bourbon, oak, or hazelnut. The nasal raisins seem to be dominant. No alcohol (18.9% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate as it warms while being held in the mouth. Alcohol on the exhale. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.\\nPalate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.\\nFinal impression and summation: 4. The appearance in unremarkable, looking like any headless imperial stout. The aroma is most like Flying Dog’s Raison D’Etre, at least to my burnt-out lab nose. In the flavor I find no hint of hazelnuts, oak, or bourbon, just a generic sweetness with a hint of DARK FRUIT, something I didn’t taste (other than raisins) until I was typing this summary.

This honestly didn't really have a head to it, so I can't really comment on the head, but there was a very thin dark drown lacing around my glass.\", \"The aroma was heavy on the ancho chilies, which was super pungent upfront. It wasn't a one-note smell though, the ancho chillies served as a backbone for an overall savory, slightly sweet, and unique aroma supported by bitter coffee notes and a slight caramel sweetness from the roasted malts. The aroma almost reminded me a little of Korean red pepper paste, but I can also see people thinking this also smells a bit like soy sauce.\", \"The taste more or less followed the aroma. The taste of the ancho chillies with a mellow coffee backbone permeated throughout the entire stout from start to finish. Although this beer primarily tasted of ancho chilies, I was also really able to taste most of the different flavorings added to this beer. Upfront, you get the taste of ancho chilies with a mellow coffee herbalness/bitterness that was complimented with a caramel sweetness. The sweet taste of the caramel seemingly disappeared towards the middle and end, which left me with the roasty taste of coffee that was also paired with notes of bitter dark chocolate and of course, ancho chillies. I couldn't necessarily taste the vanilla beans which was added to this, but I felt like it served to mellow and round out the other bolder ingredients which were added.\", \"The feel on this was medium to full bodied, had little to no noticeable carbonation, and had a moderate lingering bitterness. All which contributed in making a silky smooth drinking experience. For the ABV, this was stupid drinkable and I felt like I had to keep reminding myself to slow it down and sip. That being said, I couldn't really taste the alcohol in this and there weren't any burning sensations.\", \"Overall, I have to say that this was definitely one of the more unique beers that I've ever had. The addition of ancho chillies worked pretty well when combined with coffee, cacao nibs, and vanilla beans, which I felt made this beer a satisfying explosion (no pun intended) of savoriness, sweetness, and roasty bitterness.

I went to college in OK, and now live in Detroit, MI, so I am blown away. This beer (their flagship, in my opinion) is excellent.\\nA: Black, like when you black out from drinking too much. And if you drink too many of these, you will black out (i.e. this beer has a very high alcohol content).\\nS: Smells like bourbon, dark beer, some chili peppers (so its kind of hot), and some vanilla/chocolate.\\nT: To the point, it's excellent. Period. This is a great beer. One of the best out there, for sure.\\nM: It feels like most bourbon barrel-aged stouts (i.e. it is warm and hearty). Especially in the winter, it begs you to drink more of it.\\nO: This is a great beer. I always pick one up at Discount Drinks in Wyandotte, MI, when they have it. It's expensive, however. 12 oz. bottle retails here at $7.99. So, it's hard to buy a lot of it, but you really don't need a lot considering it's 13% ABV.\", 'Apr 22, 2020']\n",

Either that or I’ve become a huge sissy since I last had one of these a couple years back. Probably a combination of the two.

I’m never sure what to think about this bruiser. I admit I find it rather delicious and actually crave it from time to time, but it’s questionable at best as an imperial stout, and as a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, I often wonder where the stout went. From my notes and memory the 2009 original bottling was one of the best things to ever grace my belly, and unfortunately the successors haven’t quite lived up to that heavenly experience.

Its similar to my take on so many Treehouse hoppy beers: They're definitely elite tier, but so are about 40 other breweries in California alone.

Little bit of pine and some peanut skin bitterness close it out, along with the most mild ethanol flavor to help dry out all that sweetness.

Very excited.', \"500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F.\", \"Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen.\", \"Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake.\", \"Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.\", 'Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales.

Roasted malts up front with some milk chocolate and sweet molasses before the barrel kicks in.

A touchstone in the style. Whether this is better than the base Stormaktsporter is really moot point, as one is world class stout, and the other is a world class barrel aged stout. Drink them both if you get the chance. Thanks again for this opportunity Doops.', 'Aug 11, 2011']\n"

The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it.

A small swirl deposits some scant lacing along the glass.', 'Nose: The aroma is bursting with ripe, succulent citrus aromas - orange juice, pomello, and grapefruit - along with a big bouquet of ripe tropical and stone fruits. Lots of mango, some guava, pineapple, and a hint of papaya, with secondary notes of kiwifruit, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, lychee, peach, nectarine, and a remarkably sweet, exotic fruity element that I simply cannot place. The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components.', \"Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper.\", \"Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it. It's a wonderfully fruity, sweet, succulent double (verging on triple) IPA crafted with the trademark uniqueness that has made Trillium a cult classic. It embodies everything the brewery is known for, from its top-tier hops, to the pillowy mouthfeel, all packed into a whopper of a beer, that's easy and enjoyable to drink.

The head slumped slowly and I topped it off leaving most of the trub in the bottle. Dark, mahogany brown, some lazy carb bubbles visible and splotches of chunky lace smeared on the glass.\\nThe aroma - or should I say bouquet of this amazing ale is sumptuous. Still, I smell rich ale fruit - yeasty rising brown bread, raisins and milk chocolate, then when I swirl the glass new aromas of smoked rum, grass and wet dog.\\nFlavor is even more complex and intriguing than the nose. Rich, fruity malt up front, notes of cherries and more raisins or figs, chocolate covered caramel all blend together deliciously. Hop flavors and bittering moves in mid swallow and wrap the tongue in a warm peppery blanket while the sweet, malt character coats the rest of the mouth in a variety of subjective ale-fruity notes. It's like but not like you took different flavored sweet tarts and mixed them with a pumpernickel bagel and some dark rum......nah.... this is way better.\\nBody is on the soft side of full with incredible mouth feel and the 10% so well folded into the beer, it only adds and never detracts from the overall amazing flavor profile.\\nTruly remarkable and world class example of a Belgian Grand Cru that ranks up there with Rochfort, Westmalle and Chimay.\", 'Aug 16, 2020']\n",

If Stouts are the fine coffee and chocolate of the beer world, this is the craft soda. There's a great combination of dark fruits, vanilla, and something vaguely tropical (reminds me of coca-cola as well somehow). Finishes with a pleasant alcohol heat that warms you up; probably ideal for the winter as opposed to now. Will probably save the rest for that season.\", 'Feel: Probably the highlight, feels practically like drinking hot chocolate. Comforting, thick, and warm. Best enjoyed in small sips, as it really is a lot to take in with each drink you take. The alcohol burn really actually boosts this beer quite a bit as opposed to most styles. Additionally, the beer is quite carbonated for such a high ABV, making it smooth rather than syrupy.', \"Overall: Pricey, but probably worth it in the end. This beer is perfect for a freezing winter night with pot roast or something like that. If you don't like Stouts or Porters, this might be worth a go as a cold weather choice. It has an entirely different flavor profile while still warming the soul.\", 'Jul 03, 2020']\n"

When held to the light, the ale become a bright, firey scarlet red, absolutely streaming with bubbles. The elixir is topped with four fingers of dense, foamy, khaki head that retains its shape for an eternity, eventually settling fiwn to a finger, leaving tenacious lacing in its wake. What a stunning beer.', 'Nose: Rich roasted malts evoke aromas of cola, prunes, raisins, figs, dates, cherries, red apple, allspice, nutmeg, dark bread, ale yeast, Belgian yeast esters, brown sugar, toffee, milk chocolate, some European spicy hops, a slight metallic note, and just the faintest whiff of funk.', \"Palate: I had to take a minute with this one, because after the first sip, I realised that I was dealing with something significantly more complex and nuanced than I had anticipated. This is going to be interesting. Let's begin.\\nUpon greeting the palate, the ale carries a mild malt sweetness, with an absolute ton of maltiness. Fresh baked still soft dark bread, rum-soaked fruit cake, and cola emerge, peppered with dark spiced rum notes. An explosion of dark fruit reveals notes of prune, fermented cherry, dates, raisin, and fig. Along with these dark fruit notes comes a character I generally only find in red wine cask-aged ales - fruity, yet dry wine grape/red berry notes, with the typical fermented wine flair. This actually shifts along with the dark fruit notes to become fairly earthy, and extremely similar to the port note in a port cask-aged imperial stout. Some subtle European hop spice and earthiness pair up with this wine-like character, and the initial malt sweetness begins to fade to the background, followed closely behind by much of the dark fruit notes. Into the finish, it becomes earthy and spicy, with the earthiness coming primarily from hops, but some of that tawny port note still lingers. At this point - well into the finish - the flavour takes a turn, and it suddenly takes on the characteristics of a traditional German amber/dark lager. The caramelised bread notes, the subtle spicy hopes, and most of all, the yeast flavour takes on a lager-esqu flavour, complete with the very subtle metallic note. The cola, spice, sweetness, malt, dark fruit, and earthiness fade away, and the ale concludes with the aftertaste of European hops and a whisper of dark bread.\", \"Mouthfeel/Body: The body is rather unique, because it's both rich and crisp at the same time. It greets the palate medium-bodied, with a very tight crispness about it. Soon after, the maltiness lends a big, soft, not-quite-chewy richness to it, pushing it close to full-bodied territory, but constantly remains balanced by a very lively fizzy effervescence. It's wet, soft, and even a bit slick upfront, but as it finishes, it dries out and becomes fairly crisp once again. There are stages where the ale is crisp, medium, and full-bodied, but it's a harmonious transition, and in the end, I would put this in the medium-bodied category. Slight acidity in the first half of the beer, which is slowly extinguished by the malt. Semi-dry finish with mild drying properties, and some slight hop resin cling. Becomes sticky around the lips. Very mild alcohol warmth from the back of the throat to below the sternum, from its 10% ABV, and fluid nature.\", \"Overall: This is a truly fine example of nuance, and does not strike me an an ale that is easy to properly brew. There is a lot going on in here, but it's never loud or abrasive. It's soft, friendly, and comforting, offering a warm, gentle embrace, and a velvet caress. I've never had Westvleteren 12, but if it's truly significantly better than this, then that must be one spectacular beer. I hope someday to try it, but for now, this stands as the best Belgian quadruple I've had to-date.\", 'Feb 01, 2020']\n",

Moderate amounts of spotty lacing marks the glass as I consume this novelty beverage.\\nS: Holy fuck. As soon as I opened the beer, it was like being exposed in a room filled ankle-deep with maple syrup. The maple is unreal, and honestly fills the surrounding space of my humble abode. Even my wife noted the maple smell from a distance. Despite maple being the star of the show, roasted coffee and malts are also detectible on the nose.\\nT: As expected from the nose, the amount of maple makes you question if your existence was previously based on a maple tree-based beetle. Maple is present from the initial flavor to the very finish, and resides in an abundance in the aftertaste. Second to maple, molasses and coffee come next in a cascading order of events. The finish comprises an abundance of maple with underlying chocolate malts, molasses and nice black-coffee bitterness. Milk chocolate flavor also linger in the aftertaste.\\nF: Full in body, heavy in weight. The carbonation levels are at the perfection point- slight fizz on the tongue but the beer still approaches chewy status. It is creamy, full, thick and delicious. Alcohol is completely hidden, making this beer a sweetly lethal offering. Zero alcohol presence, which is testimonial for an 11% brew.\\nO: Can't say much other than this beer is phenomenal from the can. I am a huge fan of maple flavoring, and thankfully, the maple out weights the coffee by a long shot. On tap, I really enjoyed the beer; from the can, this beer is amazing. For 11 percent, this beer is the definition of a lethal weapon. Chocked full of sweet maple flavor and subtle milk chocolate with a malty finish. From the can, the beer tastes much more balanced and places a greater emphasis on maple syrup and other flavors than what I experienced on tap. I disagree with those that say it is unnatural tasting- its tastes natural, just with an abundance and overload of natural flavors than could be perceived as overwhelming. This beer is fucking great.

Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there\\'s that \"so sweet, it\\'s somehow bitter\" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don\\'t need to have this again either way.', '3.24/5: Syrupy and absurdly sweet - perfect for the hypetrain crowd!', 'Dec 16, 2018']\n",

A smoothly bitter pine-resin bite coats the tongue pleasantly, only for a complex wave of honey, biscuit, and caramel malt to balance it out. The lingering bitterness is grapefruit pith and pinecone flavored. The honey has clearly been used to up the ABV and in no way makes Hopslam sweet, and also adds natural complexity.

Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here.

It melds sweet maple syrup with black coffee and chocolate syrup, and for whatever reason that\\'s taken me for a moment back to my days in the Boy Scouts. It\\'s clean and bright and enticing although I haven\\'t really found the bacon yet, just a suggestion of it. OK, on to the flavor... more coffee, basic, but good, just like a regular cup of Joe black coffee... more maple syrup as expected, and kind of sweet... chocolate syrup... some vanilla... but I\\'m still not finding the bacon. I wasn\\'t really expecting bacon, but maybe some apple smoked wood maltiness...? Or am I missing it? I get coffee, maple, toffee, almost burnt but not sugar, vanilla, medium to darker caramel, some background fruitiness, and a bit of ashen roastiness. Is it smoky? I don\\'t think so, not really, there is some in the far away background but I wouldn\\'t consider it smoky. Still, it\\'s good. It\\'s nice and rich without being overly so, and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate. It\\'s not really a dessert beer though, or is it? It could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own? Ahhh, maybe. So, OK, what else? Medium bodied and gently crisp then smooth.', 'Review# 6,436', 'Dec 26, 2018']\n",

So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind.

I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation.

    "Our recommendation stays the same even if we use word vectors instead of plain vanilla bag-of-words cosine similarity. But we did notice that the similarity scores increased significantly after we used word vectors. One possible explanation is that the exact attributes words we picked (i.e. malty, balanced, complex) did not show up in the reviews a lot of times (low cosine similarity scores), but there were plenty of words that have similar meanings to these attributes appeared in the reviews (high spaCy similarity scores). We think this is acceptable because these words with similar meanings will describe the characteristics of a beer the same way as the attribute words we selected. Since the products we recommend are the same using these two methods, we can not analyze the difference in % of reviews that mention a preferred attribute. But we do believe that the identical results further indicate it’s reasonable to recommend these products to customers who are looking for balanced, malty, and complex beer.\n"

    "If we simply choose the 3 highest rated products, our recommendation changes to Chemtrilmix, It Was All A Dream, and SR-71. We do not believe that these products will meet the requirements of users who are looking for balanced, malty, and complex beer. The main reason is that reviews related to these three products did not mention anything about the ‘malty’ or ‘complex’ attribute. Although Chemtrilmix and SR-71 have reviews related to the ‘balanced’ attribute, their corresponding sentiment scores are much lower compared to the three brands we recommended in the previous question. It is possible that Chemtrilmix, It Was All A Dream, and SR-71 have the highest ratings because of other attributes that we did not select. They may be good beers to people who have different preferences, but they should not be recommended to customers who are looking for balanced, malty, and complex beer.\n"
